This is the code repository for the paper -- Hierarchical Multimodality Graph Reasoning for Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING). In this repository, we will provide the core code of our designed model, including data processing, data augmentation, data loading, key module and training script. If this code repository has inspired your study, research or work, please contribute your valuable STAR and cite the original paper.
