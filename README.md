# Introduction
This is the code repository for the paper -- Hierarchical Multimodality Graph Reasoning for Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (TGRS). In this repository, we will provide the core code of our designed model, including data processing, data augmentation, data loading, key module and training script. If this code repository has inspired your study, research or work, please contribute your valuable STAR and cite the original paper.[![Paper](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paper-IEEE-green)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10771709)

# Install
If you are not using Linux, do not proceed. It is recommended to use an RTX3090 GPU or a higher-computing GPU to train the test code and store the data on an SSD.

1. Clone this repository and navigate to TGRS folder.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Komi-Wang/TGRS.git
cd TGRS
```

2. Install Package
```bash
conda create -n rsvqa python=3.10
conda activate rsvqa
```
